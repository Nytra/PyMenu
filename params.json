The text will be automatically word wrapped to fit on the screen, no matter the screen dimensions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n![Image of Dynamic Resizing](https://github.com/Nytra/PyMenu-Framework/blob/master/images/resize.png)\r\nThe framework will automatically detect when the terminal dimensions have changed and it will resize the interface accordingly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##How To Use The PyMenu Framework\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n![Image of PyMenu Code](https://github.com/Nytra/PyMenu-Framework/blob/master/images/demo.png)\r\nPyMenu is designed to be easily implemented alongside existing code. The possibilities are practically endless.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##Limitations\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPyMenu currently does not support scrolling of any kind. So any text that exceeds the maximum overlay height will spill out onto the background. I am working on this.\r\n",
