A Python3 based framework for creating simple but intuitive text-based menu interfaces.

PyMenu is capable of displaying many different buttons on the screen with each one linked to a specific function.

PyMenu can display dialog boxes which contain text. The text will be automatically word wrapped to fit on the screen, no matter the screen dimensions.

The framework will automatically detect when the terminal dimensions have changed and it will resize the interface accordingly.

##How To Use The PyMenu Framework

PyMenu is designed to be easily implemented alongside existing code. The possibilities are practically endless.

##Limitations

---

PyMenu currently does not support scrolling of any kind. So any text that exceeds the maximum overlay height will spill out onto the background. I am working on this.
